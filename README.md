# Automation Garden 🌿

This is a growing collection of practical scripts and mini-projects I've created to make life a little more effortless, curious, and joyful. Each folder is a self-contained script with its own story, and most are featured on my blog [here](https://alinaaleks.github.io/projects/).

✨ Topics: file management, data wrangling, productivity tools
